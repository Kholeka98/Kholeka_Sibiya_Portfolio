[Project 1: Exploratory Data Analysis](https://github.com/Kholeka98/Data_Cleaning_Excel/blob/main)

## Project Objective
The primary objective of this project is to provide actionable insights to the marketing team regarding sales performance across various locations and product types. By addressing key questions such as revenue generation per location, the correlation between price and product sales across different product types, and identifying the highest revenue-generating product types, this initiative aims to empower the marketing team to optimize revenue streams effectively. Ultimately, the project seeks to facilitate informed decision-making and the formulation of targeted strategies to enhance overall sales performance and maximize revenue potential.

**Skills**: Python, Business Analysis, Data aggregation, and Data visualization

[Project 2: Performance Evaluation Analysis](https://github.com/Kholeka98/Performance-Evaluation/blob/main)

## Project objective
The objective of this SQL project is to conduct a comprehensive performance analysis of four products based on their quantity sold and revenue generated. Through the utilization of SQL queries and database management techniques, this project aims to:
- **Analyze Product Performance**: Evaluate the sales performance of four products within a given timeframe by examining their respective quantities sold and revenue generated.
- **Identify Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**: Determine key metrics such as total revenue, average revenue per product, total quantity sold, and average quantity sold for each product.
- **Compare Product Performance**: Compare the performance metrics among the four selected products to identify trends, patterns, and disparities in sales volume and revenue generation.
- **Uncover Insights**: Extract actionable insights from the analysis to understand which products are performing well and which may require further attention or improvement strategies.
- **Inform Decision-Making**: Provide stakeholders with valuable insights to inform decision-making processes related to product management, marketing strategies, inventory planning, and resource allocation.

**Skills**: Excel, SQL, SQL queries, and Database Management
